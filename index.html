        <p>Hello, my name is Kenyatta, but I go by Kenny. I currently live in Utah, but I was born in AZ.  
          I have 5 boys which only my 2 youngest still live with me, (14 and 20).    
          I spent 27 years in the grocery retail industry which I currently no longer do.  
          I was in Management for 19 of the 27 years and the most rewarding aspect was all of the associate’s careers I got to be a part of.  
          I really love inspiring others and due to layoffs and a blessing in disguise, I’m finally going after my passion.  
          My goal is to get into IT, Programing, or Cybersecurity.</p> 
          <p>My top 2 loves are my kids, and our hobbies are video games and action movies and secondly, basketball which I play weekly.  
          I’m also a certified master diver with about 60 or 70 logged dives, (I haven’t caught up my dive log) since late 2016.  
          I’ve been to Hawaii, Honduras, and Curacao.  I didn’t dive at all in 2019, but I will get back in the swing of things in 2020.</p>
