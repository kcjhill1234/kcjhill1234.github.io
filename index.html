    <h1>Hi this is Kenny Hill</h1>
        <p><em>I</em> am really trying to get this coding to work for me</p>
        <p>So to start off,  <em>I</em> thought this class would be a blast.<p>
        <p>I even purchase a course to make sure <em>I</em> would like it but <em>I</em> didn't get to far in the course.  
        <p>Now <em>I</em> am kicking myself in the ass for not 
        getting further in the course.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>This is what <em>I</em> am going to do:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Scream
        <li>Scream again
        <li>Then calm down and ask for help
    </ol>
